          1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa 1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend
          the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known
          as the "National Youth Administration" 1935 - Has to stop school and
          save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
          starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of
          this left scars on me." 1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in
          the US Forestry Service 1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret
          Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles
          Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
          about breeding pest-resistent plants. 1941 - Tries to enroll in the
          military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the
          military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control
          malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science. 1942 - Receives a
          Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology 1944 - Rejects a 100% salary
          increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to
          Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,
          his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat -
          including different varieties for each major climate on Earth. 1945 -
          Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat
          yields 1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
          high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to
          fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. 1962 - Visits
          Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
          subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly
          expanding population 1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize 1983 -
          helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and
          sorghum yields 1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
          University 2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply
          by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we
          can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
          are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
          plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
          people were selecting the best breeds." 2009 - dies at the age of 95.
          "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
          contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
          scientific vision can make to human peace and progress." -- Indian
          Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
